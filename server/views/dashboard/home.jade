              | You know your city&period;  You know your neighborhood&period;  You know your favorite blocks and your favorite buildings&period;  OwnYourCity allows you to directly invest in specific real estate that you choose&period;  When you invest in a REIT&comma; you are investing in a holding company that may own hundreds of properties across the country&period;  If you want to take control of your investment portfolio&comma; you should be the one deciding the real estate assets in which your money is invested&comma; not an executive at a REIT sitting in an office&period;
            h3 Are these risky investments&quest;
            p
              | Yes&period;  This is an equity investment&period;  There is a potential that investors will lose money&period;  OwnYourCity simply provides investors access to real estate that they previously had no feasible way to purchase&period;  Many people are bullish on continued rental demand in NYC&comma; DC&comma; etc&period;&comma; but many do not have the resources or the desire to spend &dollar;500&comma;000 on a single investment&period;  Enabling you to decide exactly how much you want to invest &lpar;&dollar;1&comma;000&comma; &dollar;5&comma;000&comma; &dollar;20&comma;000&comma; etc&period;&rpar; on these exact same units allows you to gain exposure to these specific real estate markets&comma; while at the same time diversifying your investable assets across different locations and asset classes&period;
            h3 What if additional capital is needed for an investment&quest;
            p
              | Once investors commit their designated amount of equity&comma; they will never be required to invest more than this initial amount&period;  However&comma; real estate is a risky asset&comma; and it can never be guaranteed that a pipe won&#65533;t break&comma; or that the refrigerator and dishwasher won&#65533;t all of a sudden fail&comma; or any number of other similar scenarios&period;  If this were to occur&comma; and there were not sufficient rental cash flow coming in to cover these capital expenditures&comma; then more equity would be needed&period;  OwnYourCity would raise or contribute the necessary equity&comma; and the original owners would be proportionately diluted&period;
            h3 Why are these investments being made with all equity&quest;
            p
              | We believe that when investing in this type of core cash-flowing real estate&comma; the risk of having a mortgage outweighs the benefits&period;  People obtain mortgages for their homes because they would prefer to make a 20&percnt; down payment as opposed to a 100&percnt; down payment&period;  But with the power of the crowd&comma; this concern disappears&comma; as you can decide to contribute in whatever increment you desire&period;  Yes&comma; without debt you lose leverage on your returns&comma; but these are stable long-term investments&period;  We believe that our investors would gladly exchange returns for much lower risk&period;  If the unit is temporarily vacant for a few months&comma; or if the actual rental rates aren&#65533;t quite what were projected&comma; in our business model&comma; it won&#65533;t be a deal-killer&comma; it will be a temporary blip on the radar&period;  We are offering investments in neighborhoods that we believe will be better in 5 years than they are right now&period;  If those things were to occur in a unit that had an 80&percnt; LTV mortgage and vacancy for a few months meant that we couldn&#65533;t make interest payments&comma; we could potentially lose the property and all of the invested equity&period;  If investors are simply searching for yield&comma; they will not be attracted to OwnYourCity&comma; but will instead be more interested in other sites that offer much&comma; much riskier deals&period;
            h3 When will we be able to begin investing in deals &quest;
            p
              | We anticipate offering the first live deals in late spring 2014&period;  The JOBS Act has been signed into law by Congress&comma; but it is still in the process of being implemented by the SEC&period;  As soon as that occurs&comma; we will be ready to move forward&period;
